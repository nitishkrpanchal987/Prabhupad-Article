                <h1>BhakhtiVedanta</h1>
                <p><b>Abhay Charanaravinda Bhaktivedanta Swami</b> (IAST: Abhaya Caraṇāravinda Bhakti-vedānta Svāmī; 1
                    September 1896 – 14 November 1977[1]) was an Indian Gaudiya Vaishnava guru who founded ISKCON,[2]
                    commonly known as the "Hare Krishna movement".[1][3][4] Members of ISKCON view Bhaktivedanta Swami
                    as a representative and messenger of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.[5]

                    Born in Calcutta (now Kolkata) in a Suvarna Banik family,[6] he was educated at the Scottish Church
                    College.[1] While working at a small pharmaceutical business,[7] he met and became a follower of
                    Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. In 1959, after his retirement, he left his family to become a sannyasi
                    and started writing commentaries on Vaishnava scriptures.[8] As a travelling Vaishnava monk, he
                    became an influential communicator of Gaudiya Vaishnavite theology across India and the Western
                    world through his leadership of ISKCON, founded in 1966.[9][10] He was well regarded by a number of
                    American religious scholars but was criticised by anti-cult groups.He has been described by his
                    followers as a charismatic leader, who was successful in acquiring followers in many Western
                    countries and India.[12][13][14] After his death in 1977, ISKCON, the society he founded based on a
                    form of Hindu Krishna Bhakti using the Bhagavata Purana as a central scripture, continued to grow.
